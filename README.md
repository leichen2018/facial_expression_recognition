## Facial Expression Recognition

This is a repo for CSCI-GA 2566 Foundations of Machine Learning course project, **Activation Map Comparison between SVM and CNN**.

Deep learning has derived several state-of-the-art methods in computer vision
tasks in recent years. This project’s purpose is to re-introduce statistical learning methods,
including SVM, to a classic vision task. The selected task is to recognize 7 emotions from
facial expressions of 48 × 48 pixel images and finally evaluated by accuracy.
